Who is Sowjanya? Does she even exist outside of this website? Certainly. I assure you that I'm a fully functioning Homosapien (sort of). I'm a front-end developer whose love for coding started after failing my first computer science test in grade 11.

Fast forwarding a bit, I graduated with Bachelor's Degree in Information Science and Engineering from New Horizon College of Engineering. I was placed in a Japanese company called Notespace Inc, where I currently work.

My main focus these days is honing the skills I already possess, creating efficient and clean websites, and enhancing user experience and functionality.
